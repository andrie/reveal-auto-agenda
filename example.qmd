# Motivation

## Why?

To help people follow the logical flow of a presentation, it is useful to show all top level headings in a single agenda slide.

But it can be tedious to construct an agenda slide by hand, by copying all the top level headings.

This extension automatically constructs an agenda slide from the top level headings.

# Mechanics of `reveal-auto-agenda`

## Using the extension

Add this to the yaml header:

``` yaml
filters: 
  - reveal-auto-agenda
```

Then sit back and watch your agenda slide build itself.

## Where does the agenda show up?

The extension inserts the rolling agenda on every slide with H1 heading.

## Can H1 header slides contain content?

No.

Other than the header, leave these slides blank - the agenda will form the content of the slide.

## Customization {.smaller}

You can customize the bullet type (none, bullets or numbered) and optionally add a heading.

``` yaml
filters:
  - reveal-auto-agenda
auto-agenda:
  bullets: numbered
  heading: Agenda
  clickable: true
```

## Customization 2 {.smaller}

You can change these options:

-   `bullets`:

    -   Change the agenda slides to have:

        -   `none`: No bullets or numbers
        -   `bullets`: Bullet list (the default)
        -   `numbered`: Numbered list

-   `heading`:

    -   If you set this option, then each agenda slide will have a heading above the agenda list.

    -   Use this to set a heading to "Agenda", "Table of Contents", or similar.

-   `clickable`:

    -   Set to true to make the list items clickable (default = false).

# Don't add agenda {.no-auto-agenda}

If you want to suppress the agenda on a particular slide, add the class `no-auto-agenda` to the slide:

``` md
# Header {.no-auto-agenda}
```



# Have fun

## That's it.

Have fun!
