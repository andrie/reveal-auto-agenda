# reveal-auto-agenda

A quarto extension for `reveal.js` that automatically creates agenda slides from H1 heading titles.

## Installation

To install this extension in your current directory (or into the Quarto project that you're currently working in), use the following command:

```shell
quarto install extension andrie/reveal-auto-agenda
```

## Enabling

Add this to your document or project options:

```yaml
filters:
  - reveal-auto-agenda
```

## Usage

Simply create your slides as normal, with H1 header slides marking transitions between agenda items.

Important: the extension assumes that your H1 header slides contains no other content, and that you want these slides to be replaced by the rolling agenda.

This extension:

- Creates a list of the text of each H1 slide.
- Insert this list into the body of each H1 slide.
- Inserts CSS that marks the active section with a border box around the text.

## Example

![Screenshot of three slides containing the outline, with from left to right, the 100 percent opacity bullet list item for the active section and the two other items in 25 percent opacity, on the second slides, first and third items are 25 percent opacity but not the second, and finally on the third slides, the first two items are 25 percent opacity.](example.png)

## Custom CSS

The extension will create custom CSS elements. You can override these in your own CSS template:

```css
.agenda {
}

.agenda-slide h1 {
  size: 0em;
  display: none;
}

.agenda-inactive {
  opacity: 0.25;
  margin-top: -0.5em;
  margin-bottom: -0.5em;
}

.agenda-active {
  margin-top: -0.5em;
  margin-bottom: -0.5em;
}
```

## Global options

To change the default behaviour, include `auto-agenda` options in your yaml:

```yaml
filters:
  - reveal-auto-agenda
auto-agenda:
  bullets: numbered
  heading: Agenda
  clickable: true
```

You can change these options:

| Option      | Description                                                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bullets`   | Change the agenda slides to have:                                                         |
|             | \- `none`: No bullets or numbers                                                          |
|             | \- `bullets`: Bullet list (the default)                                                   |
|             | \- `numbered`: Numbered list                                                              |
| `heading`   | If you set this option, then each agenda slide will have a heading above the agenda list. |
|             | Use this to set a heading to "Agenda", "Table of Contents", or similar.                   |
| `clickable` | Set to true to make the list items clickable (default = false).                           |

## Exclude auto-agenda from specific slides

If you want to suppress the agenda on a particular slide, add the class `no-auto-agenda` to the slide:

```md
# Header {.no-auto-agenda}
```
